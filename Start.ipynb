    "### Usage within Google Colab\n",
    "To use Google Colab you need the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You need a Google account to create a Goolge Colab runtime. If you would like to modify and safe the notebooks a convienent way is the usage of Google drive.\n",
    "2. Copy any (or all) notebooks you'd like to use to your drive. To copy a notebook to your own Google Drive you need to do the following two easy steps: 1) open one of the example Notebooks given on this page and 2) click on the bottom \"Copy to Drive\". |At this point all notebooks are saved in your personal drive space. This allows you to run them, modify them and save them as you see fit. After this step, you do not need to come to this page anymore. You can directly got to your Google Drive and directly run any notebook you wish. The current page may be useful as it contains links to useful tips and Frequently Asked Questions.\n",
    "3. If you want to store analysis results in your Google drive please refer to the <a href=./TechnicalSupport.ipynb>FAQ</a> detailing the necessary steps to mount it in a Google Colab runtime. **Note** that you have to mount your drive every time you (re-) start a runtime.\n",
